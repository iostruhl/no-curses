    So I really should have done this in multiple commits, but here's a completely untested maybe fully functioning stateless server. You'll probably run into a billion syntax errors because I literally haven't run this code (I was going to write tests today, but it got late, and I figured you can more easily figure out what's wrong when you actually try to hook stuff up. I can write tests later if need be). All of the pre-curses client stuff should be the same (except that I changed the event users to names because I kept confusing myself, so you'll have to update that). Once you're in game, you should only need to respond to one event, update, which should contain everything you need. I do also send broadcast_end_game at the end of the game, but the scores are in a different format so that'll need to change as well. Sheets logging has been commented out because it needs to change as well, haven't had time to do that yet. I'm sure I forgot to reset a value in boardstate somewhere, or did something else equally stupid, so feel free to just change things in server (or ask me)
